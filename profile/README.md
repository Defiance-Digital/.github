# Defiance Digital

Defiance Digital, a managed services provider from Defiance Ventures, was launched to conquer one of the most critical challenges of modern business growth—cloud management. Defiance Digital helps innovative startups and mid-sized companies scale safely by combining the technical excellence of elite cloud engineers with the strategic prowess of the industry’s top digital expansion advisors. It is a true end-to-end, cloud-centric service suite designed by experts in enterprise scaling.

The name ‘Defiance’ itself was chosen to embody the entrepreneurial spirit, a story of perseverance, problem solving, and defying conventional wisdom to create something special. Defiance Digital embodies this by helping growing companies successfully navigate notoriously complex aspects of the cloud, freeing them up to focus on driving growth and achieving their full market potential.

Defiance Digital stands out in its space with a “customers are co-workers” ethos, an innovative approach to problem-solving, and deep expertise in various areas, including AWS, security and compliance, and cloud engineering. This unique combination of MSP excellence with expert consulting has helped Defiance Digital’s customers focus on innovation without worries of security breaches, system downtime, cost overruns, staffing and talent gaps, and regulatory compliance issues.

Founder John Espey, an engineer with an entrepreneurial edge, has held executive roles at several successful IT services firms, including Amentra and Levvel, and advisory roles at nearly a dozen startups. Joining Espey to lead Defiance Digital is a seasoned team of industry experts; Adam Dillaplain, a hosting industry veteran; Matthew Bonig, an AWS Hero; Brad Boegler, a security and compliance expert, and a host of the best cloud engineers out there.
